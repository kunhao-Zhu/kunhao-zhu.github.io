Kunhao Zhu is an M.A. candidate in Information Resources Management at Nanjing University. His work focuses on digital humanities, knowledge organization, and spatial–narrative modeling with knowledge graphs.

His master’s thesis, “From Ancient Chorography to Semantic Networks: Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Construction and Visualization of Ancient Nanjing Driven by Lefebvre’s Spatial Triad,” explores how chorographic sources can be transformed into semantic networks to visualize spatial and temporal relations in historical knowledge.

Prior to graduate study, he earned a B.A. in Library Science from Zhengzhou University (GPA 3.79/4.0; rank 2/16). He has practical experience in university libraries, including circulation and cataloging at Duke Kunshan University Library and student assistant work at Zhengzhou University Library. His responsibilities have included MARC21 cataloging (Aleph/OCLC), collection relocation and shelf maintenance, copyright-compliant digitization, and bilingual patron services.

He has published in Library and Information Service, Library, and Researches in Library Science, and has a forthcoming paper at the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications. Beyond research, he enjoys building practical workflows and tools to improve library services.
